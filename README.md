# AI-Based-ISP-Ticket-Analyzer-Forecaster
AI-Based Ticket Classifier &amp; Forecaster for ISPs — built with FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, ELK, Prometheus
This project is currently in development. I'm building it step by step using the following tools and technologies:

Python for core scripting and modeling

Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and preprocessing

scikit-learn for ticket classification (machine learning)

Prophet for time-series forecasting

Matplotlib / Seaborn for basic visualizations

Flask (planned) for building a simple API or web interface

Docker for containerization and testing environments

Git for version control and tracking progress

The goal is to create a smart system that can analyze and classify ISP support tickets and forecast ticket volume to help optimize team resources. I’m actively working on the classification model and integrating forecasting logic next.
